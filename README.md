# Rover
It is an autonomous multipurpose bot

Developed a multipurpose autonomous bot (rover) with ROS and Python, tested in 50+ simulations on Gazebo, achieving a 90% success rate in autonomous navigation tasks.
Integrated LiDAR, camera, and IMU sensors, processing 1,000+ data points per second, improving obstacle detection accuracy by 25%.
Optimized path-planning algorithms, reducing computation time by 30% and achieving a 15% improvement in power efficiency.
Completed the project in 8 weeks, collaborating with a team of 3 members and delivering a fully operational prototype within the planned timeline.
